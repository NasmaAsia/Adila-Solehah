    <h2>Get to Know Me</h2>
        <section>
        <p>My name is Solehah, and I am 23 years old. I was born in Hospital Tentara Lumut, Perak, and I currently live in the peaceful town of Merchang, Marang, Terengganu. Since I was young, I have always had a deep interest in creativity, visual arts, and the way technology can be used to express ideas and tell stories. This passion has guided me throughout my academic journey and continues to inspire my future aspirations.</p>

        <p>I began my educational path by studying Multimedia at IKBN Kemaman in 2021, where I developed a solid understanding of digital media, creative thinking, and visual communication. This experience allowed me to build practical skills in areas such as graphic design, video editing, and digital illustration. After completing my studies there, I continued to expand my knowledge by pursuing a Foundation in Information Technology at UCTATI Kemaman, which I successfully completed in 2024. This program broadened my technical abilities, giving me a deeper insight into the world of digital systems, web development, and creative software.</p>

        <p>Currently, I am furthering my education by pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Digital Graphic Design at UCTATI. This course allows me to explore my creativity on a deeper level while learning essential industry skills, including branding, advertising, user interface design, and motion graphics. I am particularly drawn to the artistic side of design, where I can use visual storytelling and digital artistry to bring ideas to life. My studies have also helped me become more proficient in design software such as Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and After Effects, among others.</p>

        <p>Apart from my academic life, I am someone who finds great joy and inspiration in playing video games. Video games have always fascinated me not only for their entertainment value but also for the creativity, design, and storytelling involved in bringing virtual worlds to life. This passion for gaming often influences my creative work, giving me fresh ideas and perspectives. Additionally, I enjoy engaging in various forms of creative arts, such as digital drawing, illustration, and conceptual art, which allow me to express my imagination freely and continuously improve my artistic skills.</p>

        <p>I believe that creativity is a lifelong journey of learning, experimentation, and growth. My ultimate goal is to build a career in the creative industry where I can combine my artistic talents with my technical knowledge to create impactful and meaningful designs. Whether it's working as a graphic designer, digital artist, or content creator, I am eager to contribute my ideas, collaborate with others, and continue evolving as a creative professional.</p>

        <p>In everything I do, I strive to stay curious, open-minded, and dedicated to producing work that reflects both my passion and my commitment to excellence. I am always excited to take on new challenges, learn new skills, and make a positive impact through design and creativity.</p>
