    <h2>Get to Know Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Solehah, and I am 23 years old. I was born in Hospital Tentara Lumut, Perak, and I currently reside in the peaceful town of Merchang, Marang, Terengganu. I have always been passionate about creativity, technology, and the endless possibilities they offer when combined.

I began my educational journey in the field of Multimedia at IKBN Kemaman in 2021, where I gained essential skills in digital media and visual storytelling. Later, I completed my Foundation in Information Technology at UCTATI Kemaman in 2024, which broadened my understanding of digital systems and creative software. Currently, I am pursuing my Bachelor’s degree in Digital Graphic Design at UCTATI, where I continue to explore my passion for design, visual communication, and creative arts.

Beyond academics, I have a strong love for video games, which not only fuels my imagination but also inspires my design ideas. I enjoy engaging in various forms of creative arts, including digital illustration, graphic design, and conceptual artwork. These hobbies allow me to express myself and continuously improve my creative thinking and problem-solving skills.

With a solid foundation in multimedia and a growing expertise in digital design, I aspire to build a career where I can bring ideas to life—whether through visual storytelling, branding, or digital content creation. I am always eager to learn, collaborate, and take on new challenges that allow me to grow both personally and professionally.</p>
